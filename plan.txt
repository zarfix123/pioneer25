‚úÖ 6-Week Roadmap
Week 1: Rubric + Initial Labeling

    Finalize feature rubric (5‚Äì8 clear, quantifiable traits)

    Label 20‚Äì30 segments across 1‚Äì2 Debussy pieces

    Test and refine labeling workflow (timing, segment length, clarity)

    Start building CSV dataset structure

Week 2: Dataset Completion + Begin Feature Extraction

    Finish labeling full training dataset (aim for 100‚Äì150 segments across all Debussy works)

    Start writing symbolic feature extraction scripts (use music21, pretty_midi, etc.)

    Match each rubric item with code logic

    Validate that the extracted features align with your manual rubric

Weeks 3‚Äì4: Model Training + Refinement

    Train initial model (Random Forest or Logistic Regression)

    Evaluate accuracy on validation set

    Test on unseen pieces (Lou Harrison, Beethoven, etc.)

    Iterate:

        Refine feature extraction

        Adjust rubric encoding if needed

        Consider segment size/overlap improvements

Week 5: Output Generation + Interpretation

    Generate predictions + visualizations (heatmaps, score annotations, etc.)

    Do error analysis ‚Äî what‚Äôs failing? why?

    Document findings: which features mattered most? did the model generalize?

Week 6: Writing + Polish

    Write research paper (abstract, intro, methods, results, discussion)

    Build minimal UI or notebook interface if needed

    Finalize bibliography + citations

    Proof and submit

üîÅ Reminders:

    The paper can frame the project as ongoing or exploratory. It doesn‚Äôt need to be final.

    Use your Notivox codebase for scale/modal detection to save time.

    Always keep 2‚Äì3 example pieces (like Beethoven) completely untouched until testing.

Let me know if you want a starter rubric template, data schema, or code base next.
